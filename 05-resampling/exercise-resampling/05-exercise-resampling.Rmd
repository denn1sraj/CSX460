## Resampling

`x` is a random variable. We want to not only know what the `mean(x)` is but want to calculate the uncertainty of `mean(x)`.  Measuring the uncertainty requires repeated measurements of `mean(x)`.

- Calculate the mean of `x`.
- Calculte the `sd( mean(x) )` using the **using 10-fold resampling**.  Create your own folds, show your work.
- Calculte the `sd( mean(x) )` using the **using 10 bootstrap sample**.  Create your own folds, show your work. 

```{r}
set.seed(1) 
x <- runif(20,1,20)

#double checking the objects

str(x)
length(x)

# make sure the order of x is random before segmenting into k-fold cross validation
x_random <- sample(x, size = 20)

# double check that sample() correctly kept the values of x
sum(x)
sum(x_random)

# create the folds for k-fold
kfold_01 <- x_random[1:2]
kfold_02 <- x_random[3:4]
kfold_03 <- x_random[5:6]
kfold_04 <- x_random[7:8]
kfold_05 <- x_random[9:10]
kfold_06 <- x_random[11:12]
kfold_07 <- x_random[13:14]
kfold_08 <- x_random[15:16]
kfold_09 <- x_random[17:18]
kfold_10 <- x_random[19:20]

# double check that the folds add up to the same value as sum(x) 
sum(kfold_01 + kfold_02 + kfold_03 + kfold_04 + kfold_05 + kfold_06 + kfold_07 + kfold_08 + kfold_09 + kfold_10)
